## What is the Wsimple project?
Welcome! This project is an API and Web interface(In-development) for Wealthsimple Trade. The main goal of this project is to give developers the ability to create projects while hooking them straight into their Wealthsimple Trade account. Click [Here](https://yusuf8ahmed.github.io/Wsimple/api/api.html#app.api.api.Wsimple) for API wrapper documentation. When looking for a specific function use the left navbar to find it.
